# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the existing codebase for Horiseon's corporate webpage. The primary condition was to optimize the webpage for search engines by improving the site's accessibility by adding in alt attributes for the images and icons on the page. Along the way, a handful of issues were cleaned up, such as repairing a broken hyperlink and adding in a previously missing title. In addition, the CSS was consolidated, reorganized, and commented to match the semantic structure of the page and improve readability.
